The last update the original iPhone received was iPhone OS 3.1.3, as [[iOS version history#iPhone OS 3|iPhone OS 3.2]] was intended for [[iPad (1st generation)|the iPad]]. ===Software history=== {{main | iOS version history}} The original operating system for the original iPhone, [[iPhone OS 1]], featured [[Visual Voicemail]], [[multi-touch]] gestures, [[HTML]] [[HTML email|email]], Apple's [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] web browser, [[Conversation threading|threaded]] [[text messaging]], an "[[iPod]]" music and video player app, a dedicated [[YouTube]] [[YouTube#Platforms|app]] and a [[Google Maps#Mobile app|Maps app]] powered by [[Google Maps]]. It also included basic Phone/contacts, Calendar, Photos, Stocks, Weather, Clock, Calculator, Notes, and Settings apps. However, many features like [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]], [[Mobile app|apps]], and [[cut, copy, and paste|copy and paste]] were not supported at release, leading hackers [[iOS jailbreaking|jailbreaking]] their phones to add these features. Software updates from Apple gradually added these functions.  A v1.1 update alongside the introduction of the [[iPod Touch (1st generation)|iPod Touch]] in September 2007 included an [[iTunes Store]] app that was the first new app to be added to the system.  [[iPhone OS 2]] was released on July 11, 2008, at the same time as the release of the [[iPhone 3G]], and introduced Apple's [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] supporting native [[iOS SDK|third-party applications]], [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Microsoft Exchange]] support,&lt;ref>{{cite web |title=Exchange ActiveSync On Your iPhone 2.0 |url=https://www.imore.com/walkthrough-exchange-activesync-on-your-iphone-20 |website=iMore |accessdate=January 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref> [[push e-mail]], and other enhancements.  [[iPhone OS 3]] was released on June 17, 2009 alongside the [[iPhone 3GS]], and introduced copy and paste functionality, [[Spotlight (software)|Spotlight search]] for the [[SpringBoard|home screen]], and new features for the YouTube app. iPhone OS 3 was available for the original iPhone as well as the iPhone 3G and 3GS. However, not all features of iPhone OS 3 (like MMS in the [[Messages (Apple)|Messages]] app) were supported on the original iPhone.  iPhone OS 3.1.3 was the last version of iPhone OS (now [[iOS]]) to be released for this phone in February 2010, which never got the full iPhone OS 3 feature set because [[iOS version history#iPhone OS 3|iPhone OS 3.2]] was intended for [[iPad (1st generation)|the iPad]].  Virtually all apps released after the release of iOS 6 in late September 2012 do not run on the original iPhone, as the software development kit (SDK) was changed to no longer allow the "targeting" (minimum) of iOS versions older than 4.3 (including 3.x), or ARMv6 devices (first two generations).
