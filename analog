'''Analog devices''' are usually a combination of both analog [[machine]] and analog [[recording media|media]] that can together [[Measurement|measure]], [[Analog recording|record]], reproduce, or [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] [[continuum (measurement)|continuous]] [[information]], for example, the almost infinite number of grades of [[transparency (optics)|transparency]], [[voltage]], [[Electrical resistance|resistance]], [[rotation]], or [[pressure]]. In theory, the continuous information (also [[analog signal]]) has an infinite number of possible [[Value (mathematics)|value]]s with the only limitation on [[Angular resolution|resolution]] being the [[accuracy]] of the analog device
